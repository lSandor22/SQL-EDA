# SQL-EDA(Exploratory data analysis)

This project demonstrates an exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQL on a dataset that was previously cleaned in the SQL-data-cleaning project. The analysis begins with basic exploratory queries to understand the dataset and gradually progresses to more advanced queries, including the use of Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for deeper insights.
